The course covers key concepts like embeddings, vector similarity, and indexing for efficient semantic search. Through hands-on examples, you can gain the skills to build intelligent, modern applications directly within SQL Server. By the end of this course, you should be able to design, implement, and optimize AI-enhanced solutions using the latest features in SQL Server 2025.
