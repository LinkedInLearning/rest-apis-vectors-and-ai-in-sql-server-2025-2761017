## Course Description

This course explores the new AI-driven and developer-centric capabilities in SQL Server 2025, focusing on REST API integration, vector search, and working with large language models (LLMs). Learn how to set up and configure SQL Server to support these features, securely connect to external APIs, and bring conversational AI into your T-SQL workflows. The course covers key concepts like embeddings, vector similarity, and indexing for efficient semantic search. Through hands-on examples, you can gain the skills to build intelligent, modern applications directly within SQL Server. By the end of this course, you should be able to design, implement, and optimize AI-enhanced solutions using the latest features in SQL Server 2025.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
